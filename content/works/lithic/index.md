My first multimedia project at Janacek Academy of Performing Arts and my first try at an installation.

The subject of the piece are stones, all collected at local former quarry HÃ¡dy. A constellation of stones create an interactive environment, an interface, through which the visitor is invited to shape a generative spatial sound composition via haptic interaction.

Capacitive field sensing is used to detect one touching a stone. A touch causes a reaction by mechanical excitation of the stones (vibrational motors and solenoid magnets are used) and an advancement in the composition. Moreover, piezo pickups are used to capture the sound of the stones.
