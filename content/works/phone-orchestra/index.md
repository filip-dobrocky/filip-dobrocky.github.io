An interactive performance where the specators interpret a visual score via the flashlights on their phones.

The piece is one of the results of the first iteration of collaborative project Trychtýř by [SVITAVA transmedia art lab](https://svitava.org/). The idea came collectively, the interactive visuals were created by Matúš Stenko and I took care of the programming, computer vision and sound design.
