An interactive performance where the specators become performers, interpreting a visual score using the flashlights on their phones.

The piece is one of the results of the first iteration of collaborative project Trychtýř by [SVITAVA transmedia art lab](https://svitava.org/). The idea came collectively, the interactive visuals were created by Matúš Stenko and I took care of the programming, computer vision and sound design.

It was built using OpenCV in Python feeding data to Max via OSC, which in turn fed video data to Resolume Arena using NDI through Wi-Fi.

The piece was presented at SONDA, a festival of electroacoustic music and AV performances, in 2022 at the Brno planetarium.
