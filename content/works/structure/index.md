Structure is concieved as an audiovisual performance using generative 3D graphics and spatial sound. Synesthetic audiovisual gestalts are formed by means of micro-relationships of image and sound.

The resulting shapes of image and sound are instatiations of an abstract algotithmic structure working in virtual 3D domain - a strictly defined structure creating structures that are seemingly unpredictable.

The content itself comes from everyday life - field recordings form the basis of the sound and the 3D point clouds partly contain a model of the buildings of Brno.

This tangible matter is transformed into unrecogisable abstraction using a sort of custom audiovisual granular synthetizer in real time.
