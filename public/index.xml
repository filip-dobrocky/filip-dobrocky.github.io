      <description>Geof√≥nie is the result of the Trycht√Ω≈ô 2024 open call, the goal of which was to create a site-specific collective sound installation for Brno&amp;rsquo;s former limestone quarry H√°dy, now a nature reserve and a popular recreation area on the city.&#xA;Artyƒçok TV&amp;rsquo;s report:&#xA;The open call brought together artists of diverse backgrounds and resulted in a multi-layered spatial sound installation exploring the location&amp;rsquo;s geology. The constellation of objects, forming an IoT network, generates a varying soundscape by the means of sonification (scanning the surface of various limestones), or live processing the sound of limestones dissolving in acid.</description>

      <title>Structure</title>

      <description>Structure is concieved as an audiovisual performance using generative 3D graphics and spatial sound. Synesthetic audiovisual gestalts are formed by means of micro-relationships of image and sound.&#xA;The resulting shapes of image and sound are instatiations of an abstract algotithmic structure working in virtual 3D domain - a strictly defined structure creating structures that are seemingly unpredictable.&#xA;The content itself comes from everyday life - field recordings form the basis of the sound and the 3D point clouds partly contain a model of the buildings of Brno.</description>

      <description>My first multimedia project at Janacek Academy of Performing Arts and my first try at an installation.&#xA;The subject of the piece are stones, all collected at local former quarry H√°dy. I focused on the sonic and haptic qualities of stones, with a motivation grounded in phenomenology rather than geology. The stones attracted me with their visual purity and universality in meaning. A stone is usually associated with something rigid and stable - I question that with electro-mechanical excitation.</description>

      <description>Originaly an electroacoustic composition, later video and live performance.&#xA;The main object of interest is the ùíÉùíäùíÑùíöùíÑùíçùíÜ - a mode of transport, a lifestyle or a target of a culture war. In the hegemony of automobilism, this simple and efficient way of getting through the city is often considered &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo;. The aim of this recording is emancipation of the bicycle. Field recordings made during city commutes, the noise of cars, sounds of bicycles, bicycle played as a musical instrument.</description>

      <description>An interactive performance where the specators become performers, interpreting a visual score using the flashlights on their phones.&#xA;The piece is one of the results of the first iteration of collaborative project Trycht√Ω≈ô by SVITAVA transmedia art lab. The idea came collectively, the interactive visuals were created by Mat√∫≈° Stenko and I took care of the programming, computer vision and sound design.&#xA;It was built using OpenCV in Python feeding data to Max via OSC, which in turn fed video data to Resolume Arena using NDI through Wi-Fi.</description>
