      <description>Structure is concieved as an audiovisual performance using generative 3D graphics and spatial sound. Synesthetic audiovisual gestalts are formed by means of micro-relationships of image and sound.&#xA;The resulting shapes of image and sound are instatiations of an abstract algotithmic structure working in virtual 3D domain - a strictly defined structure creating structures that are seemingly unpredictable.&#xA;The content itself comes from everyday life - field recordings form the basis of the sound and the 3D point clouds partly contain a model of the buildings of Brno (where the author resides).</description>

      <description>My first multimedia project at Janacek Academy of Performing Arts and my first try at an installation.&#xA;The subject of the piece are stones, all collected at local former quarry H√°dy. A constellation of stones create an interactive environment, an interface, through which the visitor is invited to shape a generative spatial sound composition via haptic interaction.&#xA;Capacitive field sensing is used to detect one touching a stone. A touch causes a reaction by mechanical excitation of the stones (vibrational motors and solenoid magnets are used) and an advancement in the composition.</description>

      <description>Originaly an electroacoustic composition, later video and live performance.&#xA;The main object of interest is the ùíÉùíäùíÑùíöùíÑùíçùíÜ - a mode of transport, a lifestyle or a target of a culture war. In the hegemony of automobilism, this simple and efficient way of getting through the city is often considered &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo;. The aim of this recording is emancipation of the bicycle. Field recordings made during city commutes, the noise of cars, sounds of bicycles, bicycle played as a musical instrument (using a violin bow, mallets, brushes, etc.</description>

      <description>An interactive performance where the specators interpret a visual score via the flashlights on their phones.&#xA;The piece is one of the results of the first iteration of collaborative project Trycht√Ω≈ô by SVITAVA transmedia art lab. The idea came collectively, the interactive visuals were created by Mat√∫≈° Stenko and I took care of the programming, computer vision and sound design.</description>
