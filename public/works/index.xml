      <description>Geof칩nie is the result of the Trycht칳콏 2024 open call, the goal of which was to create a site-specific collective sound installation for Brno&amp;rsquo;s former limestone quarry H치dy, now a nature reserve and a popular recreation area on the city.&#xA;The open call brought together artists of diverse backgrounds and resulted in a multi-layered spatial sound installation exploring the location&amp;rsquo;s geology. The constellation of objects, forming an IoT network, creates a soundscape by the means of sonification (scanning the surface of various limestones), or live processing the sound of limestones dissolving in acid.</description>

      <description>Structure is concieved as an audiovisual performance using generative 3D graphics and spatial sound. Synesthetic audiovisual gestalts are formed by means of micro-relationships of image and sound.&#xA;The resulting shapes of image and sound are instatiations of an abstract algotithmic structure working in virtual 3D domain - a strictly defined structure creating structures that are seemingly unpredictable.&#xA;The content itself comes from everyday life - field recordings form the basis of the sound and the 3D point clouds partly contain a model of the buildings of Brno.</description>

      <description>My first multimedia project at Janacek Academy of Performing Arts and my first try at an installation.&#xA;The subject of the piece are stones, all collected at local former quarry H치dy. I focused on the sonic and haptic qualities of stones, with a motivation grounded in phenomenology rather than geology. The stones attracted me with their visual purity and universality in meaning. A stone is usually associated with something rigid and stable - I question that with electro-mechanical excitation.</description>

      <description>Originaly an electroacoustic composition, later video and live performance.&#xA;The main object of interest is the 洧눆洧눍洧눇洧눜洧눇洧눐洧눉 - a mode of transport, a lifestyle or a target of a culture war. In the hegemony of automobilism, this simple and efficient way of getting through the city is often considered &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo;. The aim of this recording is emancipation of the bicycle. Field recordings made during city commutes, the noise of cars, sounds of bicycles, bicycle played as a musical instrument.</description>

      <description>An interactive performance where the specators become performers, interpreting a visual score using the flashlights on their phones.&#xA;The piece is one of the results of the first iteration of collaborative project Trycht칳콏 by SVITAVA transmedia art lab. The idea came collectively, the interactive visuals were created by Mat칰코 Stenko and I took care of the programming, computer vision and sound design.&#xA;It was built using OpenCV in Python feeding data to Max via OSC, which in turn fed video data to Resolume Arena using NDI through Wi-Fi.</description>
